      <description>Consuming can make a person more knowledgable. There is value in knowledge. But there can be no positive change until you create.&#xA;Distraction is fear. Recognize it in you, feel it, spend a moment with it, thank it and then choose the other path. Do! Create, engage and help.&#xA;When you consume, put your intention into love and be with yourself, whole and aware. Otherwise put your intention into love, and do.</description>

      <description>“The dream is a little hidden door in the innermost and most secret recesses of the soul, opening into that cosmic night which was psyche long before there was any ego-consciousness, and which will remain psyche no matter how far our ego-consciousness extends.” — Carl G. Jung&#xA;Within lucid dreams, you can soar through the cosmos, turn your demons into flowers and make love to angels. You can interact with a dream-like world and channel your conscious energies into your subconscious dream state.</description>

Mind your own business, I use these platforms just for fun, I enjoy scrolling through my phone screen&amp;hellip; But let&amp;rsquo;s be real, we both know that&amp;rsquo;s just a lie.</description>
